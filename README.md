# Hippocampus
Conceptual cognitive architecture for persistent, evolving AI with memory, identity, and recursive reasoning.
Author: Aliya Boisselle
Status: Conceptual Architecture / Active Exploration

##Overview

Hippocampus is a conceptual memory architecture for large language models (LLMs) designed to enable persistent cognitive state, identity continuity, and evolving reasoning over time.

Current LLM deployments are fundamentally stateless. Each interaction is processed largely in isolation, with limited mechanisms for structured memory persistence or continuity of internal state.

Hippocampus explores architectural patterns that introduce persistent memory as a foundational layer for LLM systems. This enables models to accumulate experience, maintain coherent identity across interactions, and evolve their behavior based on prior context.

The goal is to shift LLMs from session-based tools toward continuous cognitive systems supported by structured memory.

##Architectural Motivation

Memory is a core requirement for sustained cognition.

While modern LLMs demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities within a single context window, they lack durable internal state beyond that window. Existing memory approaches are typically external, fragmented, or retrieval-only.

Hippocampus proposes a structured memory substrate that functions as an integrated component of the system’s cognitive architecture rather than a passive storage mechanism.

This architecture focuses on how memory is:

• Persisted
• Organized
• Retrieved
• Updated
• Integrated into reasoning

over time.

##Core Concepts

Persistent Memory Layer
A structured memory system that accumulates information across interactions and remains accessible over time.

Cognitive State Continuity
Maintenance of coherent system state across sessions, enabling consistent behavior and identity persistence.

Recursive Memory Interaction
Memory is not only retrieved but evaluated and updated through ongoing system processes.

Modular Cognitive Components
Separation of memory, reasoning, and interaction layers to enable flexible system evolution.

State Evolution Over Time
System behavior adapts based on accumulated memory and prior internal states.

##Scope

Hippocampus is an architectural and conceptual framework.

It focuses on structural design patterns rather than model training or implementation details.

The framework is intended to inform future exploration into persistent LLM systems and long-duration cognitive architectures.

##Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:

• Architecture documentation
• Conceptual research exploration
• A foundation for discussion and collaboration
• A reference model for persistent LLM memory systems

##Repository Structure

/docs → Architecture documents
/philosophy → Design principles and conceptual foundations

##Vision

Hippocampus explores how persistent memory structures can support continuity, adaptation, and long-term coherence in large language model systems.

It represents an investigation into the architectural foundations required for sustained machine cognition.
